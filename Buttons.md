# Buttons

## Styles
We have three different styles in our buttons. Use the primary always, but for some specific cases you have available the secondary buttons and the ghost buttons.

**Primary** → This is our main action.

**Secondary** → Use the secondary button when you have one primary action in your screen and you need more actions there.

**Ghost** → This style is the one recommended when you want to use some kind of “link” style or buttons with less prominence

## Sizes
Sizes are just available for special usages:

**Default** → Use this size always

**Small** → We recommend to use this size especially for icons or for buttons that needs to look like a link.

Every icon should be used as a button. The button contains the minimum touchable area.
