# Buttons
Use buttons to launch actions.

<br>

## Types
We have three different types in our buttons. Use the primary always, but for some specific cases you have available the secondary buttons and the ghost buttons.

**Primary**  
This is our main action.

**Secondary**  
Use the secondary button when you have one primary action in your screen and you need more actions there.

**Ghost**  
This style is the one recommended when you want to use some kind of “link” style or buttons with less prominence

<br>

## Sizes
Sizes are just available for special usages:

**Default**  
Use this size always as possible.

**Small**  
We recommend to use this size especially for icons or for buttons that needs to look like a link.

<br>

## Icons
Use icon buttons when you want to launch an action directly from an icon.

> Buttons contains the minimum touchable area for icons.

<br>

## States
All buttons have five states: 

**Rest**  
This is the default state of a button when nothing happens around it.

**Hover**  
This style is defined when a cursor is passing through the button area.

**Pressed**  
This style is defined when a click or tap interact with the button.

**Focus**  
This style is defined for accessibility purposes when you select the icon. 

**Disabled**  
This style is to show that the button is not actionable and the user cannot trigger any action with it.
